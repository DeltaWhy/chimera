Chimera User Guide
==================

Chimera is a content management system for static websites. If you're reading
this guide, your webmaster should have already set up a Chimera instance and
given you an address where you can log in - probably something like
http://admin.example.com

Log in with your Google account by clicking the button in the top right corner.
If you cannot log in, make sure your webmaster has given you access and that you
are using the correct account, if you have several.

Once logged in, you should see a file browser on the left hand side of the page.
Click on a file to open it. Your changes are saved automatically as you work.
You can click 'Preview' to see a preview of your edits before publishing. This
is not automatically updated - you will need to click the button again to
regenerate the preview.

When you are done editing, click on 'Publish' to make your changes live. You
will see a summary of which files you've changed, and a text box where you
should enter a short description of your edits. Click on 'Publish' again, and
your website will be updated with your changes.

Some things to keep in mind: with great power comes great responsibility. Make
sure you preview your changes before publishing, and double-check that
everything looks correct after you've published.
